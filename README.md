This project takes in a .txt file of grocery items and allows the user to
display total inventory, display the frequency of a specific item, and display
text-based histogram and create a dat file containing total inventory.

I feel that I did well on the entire project.

I believe creating a GUI for this project would enhance the project. Creating a
GUI for this project could make the program more efficient to use for the average
user.

I did not find any part of this project challenging. If I had encountered a   
problem I would have reached out to my instructor.

From this project I have learned how to use two languages to solve a problem.
I believe that I could make use of this knowledge in future courses.

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following the OOP
guidelines.
